On a daily basis, an American wakes up at 5 am for jogging, then comes back home and rushes to the bathroom to take a shower. As the working day starts at 8 am or 8.30, he/she gets a quick breakfast meal and gets dressed fast. After a morning make-up, for American ladies, and a morning shirt pressing, for American men, he/she runs to their car and heads to the working place. The usual working schedule during a week is from 8 am till 5 pm or 6 p.m. In the evening, he or she drives home and starts preparing an evening meal, called dinner. The leisure time in the evening is spent either with children, or in the night clubs with friends, or at a restaurant with a beloved person. During the weekends Americans go to a church, visit their relatives, meet with their friends, or do anything else that makes them relax.
